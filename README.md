# Middle-earthone Weather Project

## Project Overview

The **Middle-earthone Weather Project** is a hobby project developed using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind**.  
The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to integrate a live weather API and visualize weather conditions within the world of **J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth**.  

The project showcases:  
- Fetching and displaying real-time weather data.  
- Mapping weather information to locations in Middle-earth.  
- A simple, clean frontend built with modern web technologies.  

This project is intended for learning, experimentation, and as a portfolio piece.
